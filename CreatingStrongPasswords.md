# How to create strong passwords
## Introduction
We use passwords in our daily lives to protect the things that matter most to us, such as our bank accounts, social media accounts and even corporate logins. Therefore, it is imperative that we practice basic cyber hygiene such as setting strong passwords, so as to reduce the chance that hackers would succeed in running brute force attacks against our accounts, leading to undesirable circumstances such as data theft.
## What should a secure password contain?
A secure password should ideally be at least 16 characters long, as recommended by  [LMG Security](https://www.lmgsecurity.com/how-long-should-your-password-be-a-technical-guide-to-a-safe-password-length-policy/) and comprised of a series of random letters, numbers and special characters such as this:
**c&GwGKDs$76JIv&U**

Though, you might probably be wondering, how am I supposed to remember the password above? Yes, its complex and secure, but how do I remember it?

The above dillemna is also what drives many users like you to just ignore setting secure passwords altogether and just go for passwords that are already publicly available in password dumps, or consist of words that could easily be guessed using dictionary attacks.

## Passphrases to the rescue
Well... So all is lost right? Its either we use simple, easily guessable passwords, or we set a password so complex that we can never remember it?

Not necessarily. 

The comic below from xkcd suggests the revolutionary idea of using passphrases, which are easy to remember for humans, but hard for a computer to guess.

At Bob The Fixer, we specialise in fixing systems, however we thought it is part of our responsibility to use our influence to encourage proper password hygiene too. As such, we would be sharing tips we have with regards to how we keep our systems at Bob The Fixer safe from attacks.

1. **Use a passphrase**
	* Pick at least 5 random words probably based upon your hobbies, your interests, or use a random word generator such as [this site](https://untroubled.org/pwgen/ppgen.cgi)
	* Eg. PizzaGymBirdsBooksBaking
2. **Remove letters at random from each word of the passphrase**
	* Eg. pizgybirdbobakin
3. **Make it so that no one can guess it**

	Afterwhich, we clean up a bit, encoding the password for simpler storage
	
	**REDACTED**

And thats it! Creating simple and memorable passwords is not that hard after all. We hope you that this was a good read, and should you have any computer problems, remember us, Bob The Fixer :)
